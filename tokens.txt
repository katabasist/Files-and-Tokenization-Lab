what

remains
as
the

her

from

in

she
wings

and
with
the
untasted

supplies
her
care
for
thankless
greece
such
hardships
have
i
braved
her
wives
her
infants
by
my
labours
saved
long
sleepless
nights
in
heavy
arms
i
stood
and
sweat
laborious
days
in
dust
and
blood
i
sacked
twelve
ample
cities
on
the
main
and
twelve
lay
smoking
on

then
at

the

i

and
the

i
made
your
mighty
monarch
these
in
peace
possessed
some

my
soldiers
had
himself
the
rest
some
present
too
to
every
prince
was
paid
and
every
prince
enjoys
the
gift
he
made
i
only
must
refund
of
all
his

see
what
preeminence
our
merits
gain
my

his

delights
my

alone
must
bless
his
lustful

the

let
him
as
he
may
enjoy
but
what's
the
quarrel
then
of
greece
to
troy
what
to
these
shores
the
assembled
nations
draws
what
calls
for
vengeance
but
a

cause
are
fair
endowments
and
a
beauteous
face
beloved
by
none
but
those
of
atreus'
race
the
wife
whom
choice
and
passion
both
approve
sure
every
wise
and
worthy
man
will
love
nor
did
my
fair
one

claim

as
she
was
my
soul
adored
the
dame
wronged
in
my
love
all
proffers
i
disdain
deceived
for
once
i
trust
not
kings
again
ye
have
my
answer
what
remains
to
do
your
king
ulysses
may
consult
with
you
what
needs
he
the
defence
this
arm
can
make
has
he
not
walls
no
human
force
can
shake
has
he
not
fenced
his
guarded
navy
round
with
piles
with
ramparts
and
a
trench
profound
and
will
not
these
the
wonders
he
has
done
repel
the
rage
of
priam's
single
son
there
was
a
time'twas
when
for
greece
i
fought
when
hector's
prowess
no
such
wonders
wrought
he
kept
the
verge
of
troy
nor
dared
to
wait
achilles'
fury
at
the
scæan
gate
he
tried
it
once
and
scarce
was
saved
by
fate
but
now
those
ancient
enmities
are
o'er
tomorrow
we
the
favouring
gods
implore
then
shall
you
see
our
parting
vessels
crowned
and
hear
with
oars
the
hellespont
resound
the
third
day
hence
shall
pthia
greet
our
sails
if
mighty
neptune
send
propitious
gales
pthia
to
her
achilles
shall
restore
the
wealth
he
left
for
this
detested
shore
thither
the
spoils
of
this
long
war
shall
pass
the
ruddy
gold
the
steel
and
shining
brass
my
beauteous
captives
thither
i'll
convey
and
all
that
rests
of
my
unravished
prey
one
only
valued
gift
your
tyrant
gave
and
that
resumed
the
fair
lyrnessian
slave
then
tell
him
loud
that
all
the
greeks
may
hear
and
learn
to
scorn
the
wretch
they
basely
fear
for
armed
in
impudence
mankind
he
braves
and
meditates
new
cheats
on
all
his
slaves
though
shameless
as
he
is
to
face
these
eyes
is
what
he
dares
not
if
he
dares
he
dies
tell
him
all
terms
all

let

stay

demand

the

around

how
shall
thy

stay
behind
the

peleus
when
from

he
sent
thee
early
to
the

youth
as
then
in
